# Long-term Project Goals

This file outlines the overarching goals of the project—both in terms of biological insights and the development of methodological and technical approaches.

## 1. Biological Insights

The project aims to generate new knowledge about the biological significance of non-coding RNAs. This includes:

* **Analysis of specific gene functionalities**

  For example, the gene `rnpB`, which plays a key role in RNA processing.

* **Investigation of strand orientation**

  How does the reading direction influence gene expression and regulatory processes?

* **Systematic classification of sRNAs**

  Which functional groups can be identified, and how frequently do they occur in specific organisms?

## 2. Method Development

In addition to biological questions, the project is focused on advancing sustainable methodological approaches:

* **Automated processing pipelines**

  Development of robust scripts for processing, filtering, and standardizing genetic sequence data.

* **Structuring & integration into semantic systems (e.g., Wikibase Cloud)**

  Transformation of raw biological data into structured, linked knowledge systems to enable better querying and analysis.

* **Establishment of a relational database / knowledge base**

  This enables queries such as “Show all small non-coding RNAs in *E. coli* with more than 80 bases”.

* **Linking with external data sources**

  Integration of reference data from Rfam, NCBI, or organism-specific databases.
