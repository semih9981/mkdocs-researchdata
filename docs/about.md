# About the Project

## Objective

The project analyzes genetic sequence data with a focus on **small non-coding RNAs**. The aim is to represent biological complexity in a structured, machine-readable form and to explore new approaches for data reduction, visualization, and querying.

## Why Simplified Sequence Representation?

Because RNA sequences are often very long and difficult to read, a full representation is deliberately omitted during preprocessing. Instead, descriptions are provided through features such as base count, in order to convey relevant information more compactly.

## Methods and Technologies

* **Wikibase Cloud instance** for structured storage
* **SPARQL** for targeted queries (e.g., "all instances of small non-coding RNA")
* **Preprocessing with Python** to shorten/normalize sequences
* **Reference databases:** including [Rfam](https://rfam.org/)
